# :coffee: Python Scripts for Image Processing

This repository contains some scripts for restauration and enhancing of images.
You can find some filters as

- Histogram Equalization.
- Median filter.
- Inverse filter.

Some compression algorithms are also provided. You can find the basic jpeg compression technic. Have a look at [jpeg_comp.py
](jpeg_comp.py).

In addition, I made a TIFF encoder to save your numerical data arrays. TIFF is a very important format to save image without any loss. Have a look at [tiff4.py](tiff4.py).
