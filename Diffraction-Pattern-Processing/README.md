# Image-Processing
Tools to process and analise scattering patterns. As part of the implemntation, the fantastic library FabIO 
has been used. You can find it at [https://github.com/kif/fabio](https://github.com/kif/fabio).

## GIWAXS pattern processing

The file can be found under the name [gui039GIWAXS.py](gui039GIWAXS.py).
You will need matplotlib v1.4.2.
This program has been used on Windows machines.
To run on a Linux machine, you must delete this line at the end of the file.

`ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxA(0, mess, "Update python", 1)`

## Neutron scattering pattern processing

The file can be found under the name [FIGARO_1.2.py](FIGARO_1.2.py).

## Outlook

- Tidy the code of this practical tool.
- Write modules for different tasks.
- Build setup.
- Improve the graphical outputs.
